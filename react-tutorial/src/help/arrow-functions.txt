<button className="square" onClick={function(){alert('click');}}>

<button className="square" onClick={()=>alert('click')}>


onClick={() => alert('click')}, 
weâ€™re passing a function as the onClick prop. I
t only fires after a click. 

Forgetting () => and writing onClick={alert('click')} 
is a common mistake, 
and would fire the alert every time the component re-renders.
