React Component
* small and isolated pieces of code 
* takes in parameters called props
* return hierarchy of views to display via the render() method

render()
* returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render
* syntax - “JSX” 
* The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div')


“JSX”
* can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX

React Element
* Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

setState
* when call setState in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside of it too.

// ShoppingList --> react componenet class/ react component type

class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />

// ShoppingList component only renders built-in DOM components like <div /> and <li />
// can compose and render custom React components too
e.g. we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing <ShoppingList />
