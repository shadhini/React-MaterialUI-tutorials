Props
-------------------------------------

react handles data with properties ("Props") and with state.

props are read-only

// when set properties

If you open up React DevTools and inspect the Table component, 
you’ll see the array of data in the property. 
The data that’s stored here is known as the virtual DOM, 
which is a fast and efficient way of syncing data with the actual DOM.

This data is not in the actual DOM yet, though.
