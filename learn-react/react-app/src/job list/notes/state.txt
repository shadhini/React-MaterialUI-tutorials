State
------------------------------------
With props, we have a one way data flow, but with state we can update private data from a component.
can think of state as any data that should be saved and modified without necessarily being added to a databas
e.g: adding and removing items from a shopping cart before confirming your purchase.

The state object will contain properties for everything you want to store in the state

-------------------------
retrieve the state, --> this.state.characters 
update the state, --> this.setState(), a built-in method for manipulating state. 

* You must use this.setState() to modify an array. 
Simply applying a new value to this.state.property will not work.
