JSX
-------------------------------
const heading = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1>;

 Under the hood, it’s running createElement, which takes the tag, object containing the properties, and children of the component and renders the same information.

 Non-JSX
 --------------------------------
 const heading = React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {className: 'site-heading'},
    'Hello, React!'
);


Notes:
------------------------
* "className" is used instead of "class" for adding CSS classes, as "class" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
* Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase – onclick will become onClick.
* Self-closing tags must end in a slash – e.g. <img />

* JavaScript expressions can also be embedded inside JSX using curly braces, including variables, functions, and properties.
const name = 'Tania';
const heading = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1> ;
